# Quantum Computing VR Explorer — 20 Concepts

Ordered foundational → advanced. Each becomes an interactive 3D scene.

## Tier 1: Foundations

1. **Classical Bit vs Qubit** — A bit is 0 or 1; a qubit blends both. Side-by-side: light switch vs color-blending sphere.
2. **Superposition** — A qubit in weighted combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Spinning coin with probability bars.
3. **Measurement & Collapse** — Observing forces a definite state, probabilistically. Fuzzy cloud crystallizes on touch.
4. **Bloch Sphere** — Unit sphere mapping all single-qubit states. Room-scale sphere with draggable state vector.
5. **Single-Qubit Gates** — Reversible rotations on the Bloch sphere (X, Z, H). Gate palette with animated rotations.

## Tier 2: Core Mechanics

6. **Probability Amplitudes & Phase** — Complex numbers with magnitude and hidden phase angle. Wave alignment/cancellation demo.
7. **Quantum Interference** — Amplitudes add or cancel, amplifying correct answers. 3D ripple tank with movable sources.
8. **Multi-Qubit Systems** — N qubits = 2^N states (exponential growth). Add-a-qubit histogram that explodes in size.
9. **Entanglement** — Correlated qubits, measuring one determines the other. Linked Bloch spheres with correlation tally.
10. **Quantum Circuits** — Sequence of gates on qubit wires, read left-to-right. 3D circuit builder with playback.

## Tier 3: Key Gates & Protocols

11. **CNOT Gate** — Flips target if control is |1⟩, creates entanglement. Beam-and-flip visualization on parallel rails.
12. **Bell States** — Four maximally entangled two-qubit states (H + CNOT). Orbiting entangled spheres with switchable states.
13. **Quantum Teleportation** — Transfer state via entanglement + 2 classical bits. Alice/Bob three-act protocol.
14. **No-Cloning Theorem** — Impossible to copy an unknown quantum state. Copy machine that fails on qubits.

## Tier 4: Algorithms

15. **Hadamard Transform** — H on N qubits creates equal superposition of all inputs. Parallel loading visualization.
16. **Grover's Search** — Find marked item in √N steps. Room of doors with amplitude amplification.
17. **Shor's Algorithm** — Factor large numbers via period-finding. RSA padlock + periodicity story.
18. **Quantum Fourier Transform** — Time-to-frequency domain conversion. Waveform through a prism.

## Tier 5: Real-World Challenges

19. **Decoherence & Noise** — Environment destroys quantum properties over time. Bloch sphere under bombardment with shielding.
20. **Quantum Error Correction** — Encode one logical qubit across many physical ones. Protective formation that self-heals.
